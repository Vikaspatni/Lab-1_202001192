## Identifying Functional and Non-Functional Requirements

## Q.1. Identify FRs and NFRs:

1) Functional Requirements:
* All the books should be available in system .
* For the ease of searching books should be sectioned according to their category .
* Student and Staff members should be able to request for issuing book while sitting at their ease.=
* Staff members should have access of all transactions.
* A person should not be able to login into system if he is not connected to institute's LAN network.
* The librarian should have root access of software so that he has all the data of system.
* Librarian  should be able to sort the books according to their availibility.
* If person issues a books then he should get all the updates via mail.
* System should have role based login mechanism.
* A forget password and username option should be availaible to users.
* A person should be see penalties if he doesn't return the book on time. 
* There should be privileged access for Staff and Librarian.
* A person can reissue the book incase of no advance booking of that book.
* If the book is unavailable than user can opt for advanced booking.




2) Non- Functional Requirements:
*  Durability - All the transaction should be durable.
*  Availibiltiy- User should have remote access of system all the time. The system should support in all the devices.
*  Usability - It should be new user friendly and have .
*  Safety & Security - All the data shoulde encrypted before storing in database. There should not be any breach with personal data of user.
*  User Experience  - It should be easy to use. User should find it very convinent in daily life.


## Q.2
A) Scope:
Around 5% of the world's population, or 466 million people, have hearing impairments. We will create a smartphone application that will detect infant crying, machine functioning, and vehicle horns in order to assist them and make their lives easier. AI will be used by our smartphone application to identify sound events like babies crying and automobile horns. With low bandwidth optimization for Android, this software may operate instantly.

B) Functional Requirements:
* The user should be able to log into the app and stay logged in until they purposefully log out.
* It should uses artificial intelligence to recognise significant noises. 
* Users could turn on the road crossing mode, for instance, which would send alert signals whenever a car nearby honked. 
Within a few seconds, it should be able to hear sounds and react by: 
* Notifying users when sounds are detected. As an illustration, receive an alert if a baby is crying nearby. 
* Apps with low latency and minimal power consumption are better for continuous use.
* The forecasts made by the app should be accurate. When necessary, it should ask the user to react; if they don't, alerts should be issued to the user's friends and relatives whose information has been provided and the location of


C) Non Functional Requirements:

* Safety:
 In case of any system crash/failure, user data must not be lost. Backup should be available.The system should be durable.
* Security:
There are 2 types of users - patient and doctor. Two types of different modes should be available in app and there should clear distinction in background software , so that there will be no collide.
* Software Quality and Interface:
The interface should be made in a user friendly way . User should not have to think much about using perticular option in application. It should also be new  user friendly.
